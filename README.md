# Show-Book
This Is the code for the show booking command based application, Run this on your Terminal.
In the start you willl need to enter the show names and tickets for each, then just keep booking. After tickets are empty, when it says 'No Show Tickets Are Left. Sorry For the Inconvenience... :(' press enter to see people who have booked, recommendations and tickets left... Have fun Experimantin
